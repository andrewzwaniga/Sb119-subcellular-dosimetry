This repository contains parameter control files to be used with the TOol for PArticle Simulation (TOPAS) version 3.9 for reproducing results contained within the paper "Monte Carlo calculation of Sb-119 subcellular dose using cascaded and averaged Auger electron spectra" that has been submitted to Physics in Medicine and Biology. 

## Code Usage

You must have TOPAS version 3.9 (or better) to run the code in this repository. TOPAS is now available open source on GitHub. Follow the download instructions there and set up your environment to be able to run topas from the command line on individual parameter control files. 

Once TOPAS is working, you should be able to run it on any of the text files contained in this repository. Any output files from the scorers will be saved to the local directory. To interpret the content of the scorer output data files, I suggest following the TOPAS ReadTheDocs documentation.
